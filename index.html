            <p>After eleven years, these were the first two words that Morteza Shirkhanzadeh chose to describe the complex academic and legal case that has handled serious allegations of research misconduct, violated academic freedom, workplace harassment and institutional non-compliance, and which has enveloped the past decade for the Queen’s professor.</p>
			<p>The case has had repercussions in the academic sphere internationally, as well as personally. Shirkhanzadeh has faced multiple suspensions and holds to his pay if he didn’t desist from pursuing the case. Now, he faces the possibility of termination. </p>
			<p>Sitting in The <i>Journal’s</i> editorial office, with his hands folded in his lap, Shirkhanzadeh took a deep breath and told his story from the beginning.  </p>

				<p></p>
				<p>Joining the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, his focus until Feb. 2005 was on his own research, in mechanical and materials engineering. </p>
				<p>“One of my colleagues came to me,” Shirkhanzadeh said. The individual asked if he had seen two papers, written by another Queen’s faculty member. The papers, the colleague alleged, contained scores of plagiarized materials.  </p>
				<p>“And at that time, I was not involved, but my colleague had already complained,” Shirkhanzadeh said. At the time, he added, it seemed to them the University was brushing the complaint under a rug. </p>
				<p>“He showed me that paper, and I couldn’t believe it. So I looked at it myself, and I said well, this is not acceptable. So, that’s how it started,” he said.  </p>

				<p style="display:inline">Shirkhanzadeh sent his first formal allegations of plagiarism to Queen’s administration, and to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). </p>
				<p></p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-4">
			  	<p>NSERC is a federal funding agency for engineering and science research, providing financial backing in excess of $1 billion per year to academics across Canada. </p>
				<p>The allegations sent to NSERC and Queen’s went beyond the two original articles his colleague had pointed out. Through his own research, Shirkhanzadeh presented allegations regarding 22 duplicated academic papers, uncredited diagrams and falsified data that had been published in 16 journals. </p>
				<p>The common author was Reginald W. Smith, a mechanical engineering professor emeritus at Queen’s. The academic misconduct allegations against Smith began with a paper that Shirkhanzadeh alleged pulled its major parts — results from tables, equations and substantial paragraphs — from a nearly identical paper previously published by Smith and other authors in a different journal. </p>
				<p>In his letters, Shirkhanzadeh also cited three more examples of alleged academic misconduct.</p>
			 </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p>“And I thought Queen’s would thank me for bringing the issue forward. Because their policy says that we are responsible to bring it up,” he said. “From day one, they didn’t like it.” </p>
				<p>When approached by <i>The Journal</i> to discuss each of the allegations and situations involved in Shirkhanzadeh’s eleven-year case, Queen’s administration responded via email. </p>
				<p>For instances involving other institutions, they would “not presume to comment on such items,” according the statement provided by Communications Officer Jasmine Toor. </p>
				<p>“As for those items that do appear to involve Queen's, they either are, or may be, the subject of litigation, for which reason we have no comment.”</p>

				<p style="display:inline"> a Queen’s investigation concluded that no research misconduct had occurred. </p>

				<p style="display:inline"> confirmed the connection. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p><i>“A Canadian academic continues to receive research money from Ottawa almost two years after top government advisers recommended the scientist be cut off and banned from receiving another penny because of misconduct, federal documents say,”</i> the May 20, 2008 article began. </p>
				<p>The article revealed that a 2006 convening of the NSERC integrity council had concluded that there was “sufficient evidence of misconduct” in the academic’s work. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p style="display:inline">The council had found enough</p> 
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98SXqqRmCmeQVFFSE9RMnprcmc"><p style="display:inline; color:red;"> evidence, </p></a><div class="box"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?srcid=0B98SXqqRmCmeQVFFSE9RMnprcmc&pid=explorer&efh=false&a=v&chrome=false&embedded=true" width="700px" height="500px"></iframe></div>
				<p style="display:inline">at the time, to warrant severe sanctions against Smith and an indefinite ban on funding his work. </p>

			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p>Despite this, the Canwest article revealed that Smith was still receiving between $20,000 and $30,000 per year from NSERC. Canwest had obtained the evidentiary documents through an access-to-information process. </p>
				<p> The access-to-information documents also revealed that Queen’s had known about falsified data in Smith’s work since 2002, when a technician notified the administration of misconduct he had found dating back to 1993. </p>
			  	<p>Queen’s had, contrary to Shirkhanzadeh’s knowledge, concluded at the time that there had been “gross misconduct” in Smith’s work. The Canwest article added that Smith was given a one-year suspension. </p>
				<p>The repercussions had been kept under wraps after the University and “the researcher,” as the Canwest article refers to him, signed an agreement in 2003 not to divulge the details of the instance. Federal research guidelines dictate that universities must report to granting councils if researchers receiving federal funding are found to engage in misconduct. </p>

			  </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p style="display online"> In June 2006, NSERC terminated Smith’s grants and banned him from receiving funding in the future, according to the</p>

				<p style="display:inline">published in 2010.</p>
				<p>However, a week later, NSERC received a letter from Smith’s lawyer, requesting the documents that the NSERC committee used to make its decision. </p>
				<p>Those documents would have violated the federal Privacy Act however, and, as a result, on July 28, NSERC’s vice president told Smith’s lawyers that the sanctions would be dropped. </p>
				<p>Smith passed away in May 2014. Postmedia, which acquired Canwest following its bankruptcy, was contacted for comment, however they could not provide a comment on the specific article’s removal. </p>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
			   <p class="lead" style="display:inline">In </p>
			  <p style="display:inline"> the wake of Queen’s 2005 investigation verdict, Shirkhanzadeh dove into personal research on the subject of academic misconduct. </p>
				<p>In the years following the initial allegations, he published three peer-reviewed articles in academic journals, which elaborated on his allegations of plagiarism against Smith. </p>
				<p>To him, the evidence was quantitative. “I’m a scientist,” he said simply, “and I knew these papers were fabricated.” Letting the instance slide, in his mind, was unethical. </p>
				<p>Amidst his personal research, Shirkhanzadeh began approaching University administration members. In Oct. 2009, he wrote an email to Queen’s Vice Principal (Research), Kerry Rowe, pointing to a trail of evidence on academic misconduct, which he said continued into papers published that year.</p>
				<p>“There is now considerable evidence showing that the remedial action taken by the university in 2006 was ineffective in preventing the reoccurrence of academic misconduct,” he wrote. The “remedial action”, according to Shirkhanzadeh, was Smith’s promise that practices would be implemented in his research group to prevent any further issues.  </p>
			 </div>
			 <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p>This email was one of ten sent by Shirkhanzadeh to Rowe between Oct. 2009 and Jan. 2010, including members of NSERC each time on the correspondence. Each presented further allegations of academic misconduct and pleaded with both bodies that his claims were worth a stricter investigation. </p>
				<p>Among the evidence presented, Shirkhanzadeh detailed alleged fabrication of cited research groups, use of erroneous information which had been previously used in other papers by the cited authors, and hand-drawn diagrams that didn’t appear to represent any credible data.</p>
				<p>In a Dec. 2009 email, Shirkhanzadeh said that although Queen’s assessment in 2005 found no evidence of data falsification, plagiarism or copyright infringements, it didn’t include the possibility of data fabrication.</p>
				<p>The data fabrication allegations brought forward in 2005 had not been properly investigated, he wrote. As a result, he maintained that Queen’s had not yet determined whether a breach of integrity had taken place, and that the University was therefore institutionally non-compliant. </p>
			 </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p>“Now that the case of non-compliance has been discovered, I am sending the original allegations of data fabrication with the request that the allegations be investigated in accordance with Tri-Council Policy Statement,” he wrote. </p>
				<p>The Tri-Council Policy Statement is a joint document of NSERC as well as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, which defines the policies and expectations with regard to integrity of researchers and grant councils</p>
				<p style="display:inline">In June 2010, NSERC Corporate Secretary Barbara Conway </p> 
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98SXqqRmCmeYkstZVdPS2lmbGM"><p style="display:inline; color:red;"> wrote back to Shirkhanzadeh. </p></a><div class="box"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?srcid=0B98SXqqRmCmeYkstZVdPS2lmbGM&pid=explorer&efh=false&a=v&chrome=false&embedded=true" width="700px" height="500px"></iframe></div>
				<p style="display:inline">“Given the significant period of time that has elapsed since the original case,” only his allegations against researchers from 2009 forward would be addressed through NSERC’s usual.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In August of 2010, Rowe wrote a similar letter to Shirkhanzadeh. The case had been closed, she said. Any further allegations based on this professor’s work would not be investigated. </p>

				<p></p>
				<p>LORI was Shirkhanzadeh’s database, accessible to anyone with a web connection. It allowed him to openly publish his allegations of research misconduct across Canadian institutions. </p>
				<p style="display:inline">The site was immediately picked up by news outlets, with a</p>

				<p style="display:inline"> featured in <i>Maclean’s Magazine</i> on the project only a few weeks later. </p>
				<p>“Ideally, Shirkhanzadeh says, there should be an official office to make these corrections. Part of the purpose of the web site is to show that more needs to be done,” author Todd Pettigrew wrote. </p>
				<p>However, after two years of LORI’s operation, Silverman’s replacement, Alan Harrison, pushed back against the site. On April 7, 2014, Harrison wrote a letter to Shirkhanzadeh, directing him to immediately remove 30 posts which made new allegations of research misconduct against another senior professor at Queen’s. </p>
				<p>Two weeks later, on April 28, Harrison’s directive grew into a workplace harassment investigation against Shirkhanzadeh for the material and allegations that he had posted on his site. </p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-4">
			  	<p>A meeting was scheduled for the next day, between Shirkhanzadeh, Leslie Jermyn from the Queen’s University Faculty Association (QUFA) and University officials — Harrison, Dan Bradshaw and Cynthia Fekken. </p>
			  	<p>Shirkhanzadeh made it clear during the meeting that he had no intention of removing the posts, but later added that he was willing to correct any errors in information if the University could point to them.   </p>
				<p>On June 3, Shirkhanzadeh was given an ultimatum. He had 10 days to remove his web posts, to “avoid the imposition of further discipline,” Harrison wrote in a letter. </p>
				<p>Within a few days, QUFA had been notified about the harassment investigation against Shirkhanzadeh. QUFA initiated a grievance against Queen’s the following week. </p>
			  	<p>“This is a spurious investigation designed to find the respondent guilty without having to prove that any harassment has occurred,” Jermyn, from QUFA, said at the time in a letter to Bradshaw. </p>
				<p>On July 4, the posts remained on the site. Queen’s suspended Shirkhanzadeh for a day with pay, and Harrison gave him until July 11 to comply and avoid the discipline heightening. </p>
				
			  </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">

				<p>On July 10, Shirkhanzadeh deleted nearly 30 posts. </p>
				<p>The harassment investigation continued into the first days of August, when Shirkhanzadeh was charged with workplace harassment. </p>
				<p>In order to put the issues on both sides to rest, a settlement was drafted and agreed upon at the time by Queen’s and Shirkhanzadeh. Shirkhanzadeh’s allegations and the University’s case of workplace harassment against him would both be dropped. </p>
				<p>Part of the settlement included a year-long sabbatical for the 2015 academic year, for Shirkhanzadeh to settle back into his own research outside of the confines of his teaching schedule, he told <i>The Journal.</i></p>
				<p>However, an important provision was made. If the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) — a national union for academic staff — released a report on Shirkhanzadeh’s case, the University had the right to declare the settlement void. </p>

				<p>At the time, Principal Woolf refused to provide CAUT with any of his files, but QUFA agreed to provide all the information they had available. </p>

				<p>However, CAUT was not daunted by Woolf’s refusal to cooperate. In September 2014, CAUT representatives met with Shirkhanzadeh, officials from QUFA and other members of the Queen’s faculty to discuss the allegations and how they had been handled. </p>

				<p>The investigation process followed by Memorial University was non-transparent “when examining research integrity allegations submitted in Nov. 2014,” Shirkhanzadeh wrote on his website.</p>
			  </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
			  	<p>Speaking to <i>The Journal</i>, he explained that his involvement in the Memorial case stemmed from a Queen’s professor who Shirkhanzadeh had named in previous allegations. </p>
				<p>In letters provided to The Journal, he noted that failing to conduct an adequately transparent investigation violates the Collective Agreement between Memorial University and Memorial University of Newfoundland Faculty Association. </p>

				<p style="display:inline">For the third time in a year, the letter informed him that he was suspended. Again, he wouldn’t be paid. This time, he was asked to leave for a month. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>The letter was the result of a new investigation launched by Shearer, which alleged that Shirkhanzadeh had been insubordinate to his superiors at the University. </p>
				<p>Requests had been made of him to meet with the dean of his faculty, he explained to <i>The Journal</i>, after receiving his University Survey of Student Assessment of Teaching (USAT) scores. </p>
				<p>On April 4, Shirkhanzadeh had penned a letter to associate vice-principal Dan McKeowen arguing that the scores were based on unreliable data, and therefore asking him to meet was not justified. He told The Journal that it seemed to be another retaliatory action for his whistle-blowing. </p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-4">
				<p>In his letter, he wrote that the dean gave his scores to higher administrative members “without considering the fact that the response rate for the first two questions was only 16%”. </p>
			  	<p>The minimum response rate considered representative by the Senate Committee on Academic Development (SCAD) guidelines at Queen’s is 65 per cent. </p>
				<p>On June 26, in a letter to Engineering Dean Kimberly Woodhouse, Shirkhanzadeh stated that he wished to “make it clear that I cannot and never will obey an order to prepare a “Teaching Improvement Plan” and present that plan in a meeting.”</p>
				<p>If he did, he wrote, it would come in response to an assessment practice that “is so obviously non-transparent and in gross violation of the Collective Agreement and SCAD guidelines”. </p>
				<p>Days letter, the suspension letter arrived from Shearer. The investigation had closed, and disciplinary measures would be imposed for two acts of insubordination by Shirkhanzadeh. </p>
			  </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">

				<p>Shearer cited the Collective Agreement, stating that the intent of the disciplinary action was corrective. The appropriateness rested on the cause, she wrote. As well, due to his prior disciplines, the suspension would be lengthened to a month: from July 1 to July 31. </p>
				<p>Shearer asked that he “not attend work or perform duties” at this time. As well, Shirkhanzadeh’s email would be suspended for the period. The warning of dismissal was given “if your performance or behaviour should attract the imposition of further disciplinary measures”. </p>
				<p>As of July 3, Shirkhanzadeh told <i>The Journal</i> that QUFA will be filing grievances in response to the new disciplinary measures. He had only just returned to work post-suspension when another letter arrived announcing a new investigation against him by Queen’s. </p>

				<p>During this meeting, or by written response, Shearer noted that Shirkhanzadeh would be able to “respond fully to any such allegations” and to inform him of anyone else thought relevant to speak with about the case. </p>
				<p>She also recommended that Shirkhanzadeh speak with QUFA about whether he should have legal representation during the meeting. </p>

				<p style="display:inline"> in his chair at the <i>Journal’s office</i>, hands still folded neatly in his lap, Shirkhanzadeh has little idea what’s coming next. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>“I just don’t want to become the center of all this,” he said, asking that photographs of him were minimal while telling the story in its entirety. “I just want the main issue to be out. It’s like when I write a scientific paper.”</p>
				<p>Looking back on the last decade of his life, Shirkhanzadeh explained that he had learnt a great deal about whistle-blowers — especially those who never intended it to happen. </p>
				<p>“Whistle-blowers don’t decide to become whistle-blowers. They are drawn in,” he said. </p>

				<p>If he had known the tangled mess that came from his first allegations, he admitted that he may have just kept up with his personal life and his own work. </p>			  
				<p>He is tired, he said, of walking into his own faculty building to hostility. Tired of fighting the University, tired of legalities and lawyers and allegations. But, he said, it’s too big now not to carry on. </p>
				<p>Over the last eleven years, he says that watching the culture and approach to academic integrity shift on university campuses has been painful. </p>
				<p>“If you go back ten years ago, we had very many impressive faculty members, and they were challenging the administration. But now, we’ve got this culture of complicity,” he said. He watched other professors operate “like workers on an assembly line.” </p>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
			  	<p>“Because they don’t want to jeopardize their job here,” he said. On days where he feels alone, and bombarded with reports and letters, he says he wonders why he is still doing this. </p>
				<p>“You feel so lonely,” he reiterated. He fumbled with his hands, looking for an example. “Say you’re in Egypt,” he said. “You go to the square, and there’s a revolution there. You look at the people, and you say I’m doing it for these people. I’m doing it for my people.” </p>
				<p></p>
				<p style="display:inline">“I know this isn’t like a revolution,” he admitted, “but what I’m doing, it is important? I just don’t know, who am I doing this </p><p class="lead" style="display:inline">for?"</p>
